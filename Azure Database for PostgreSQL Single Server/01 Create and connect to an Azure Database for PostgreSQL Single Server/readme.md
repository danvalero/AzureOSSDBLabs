   Select the PowerShell option for the Azure Cloud Shell
    
   ![](Media/image0013.png)
    
   If this is the first time we are opening, Azure will prompt us to select a subscription to create a storage account and Microsoft Azure Files share If so, click on **Create storage** and wait until the creation ends.
    
   ![](Media/image0014.png)
    
   When the Azure Cloud Shell is ready to use you will see a screen as the following:
    
   ![](Media/image0015.png)

1. Connect to your subscription
    
   List the subscriptions available by executing:
    
   ```bash
   az account list
   ```
    
   ![](Media/image0016.png)
    
   Identify the subscription you will use for this exercise and make sure you are on it by executing:
    
   ```bash
   az account set --subscription <subscription id>
   ```
   
   ![](Media/image0017.png)

1. Create the Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Server
    
   NOTE: You will use the resource group (**postgresqllab**) created on exercise 1 for the new server
   
   To create a server named pgserver[your name initials]2 on eastus and using a similar configuration used in exercise 1, execute:

   ```bash
   az postgres server create --resource-group postgresqllab --name pgserver<your name initials>2 --location eastus --admin-user admpg --admin-password <server_admin_password> --sku-name GP_Gen5_2 --version 11
   ```

   NOTE: Make sure you modify the server name and server admin password before executing the command. You can use a region closer to you.
    
   ![](Media/image0018.png)
    
   Go to the Azure Portal, and look for the server you just created and click on it
    
   ![](Media/image0019.png)
    
   The Azure Database for PostgreSQL have been created and it is ready for use.
   
   ![](Media/image0020.png)

Congratulations! You have successfully completed this exercise.

## Exercise 3: Configure a server-level firewall rule

Azure Database for PostgreSQL creates a firewall at the server level. It prevents external applications and tools from connecting to the server and any databases on the server, unless you create a rule to open the firewall for specific IP addresses. Server-level firewall rules enable administrators to access an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Server from a specified IP address or range of IP addresses.

**Tasks**

1. Connect to Microsoft Azure Portal
    
   Open Microsoft Edge and navigate to the [Azure Portal](http://ms.portal.azure.com) to connect to Microsoft Azure Portal. Login with your subscriptions credential.

1. Go to your PostgreSQL Server

   Go to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Server created in Exercise 1 (named pgserver[your name initials]) in any way you prefer to look for a resource on Azure. 

1. Configure firewall rule for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL Resource

   On the PostgreSQL server page, under **Settings** heading, click **Connection security** to open the Connection security page for the Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
   
   Click **Add client IP** on the toolbar. This automatically creates a firewall rule with the public IP address of your computer, as perceived by the Azure system. Change the name of the rule to *MyClientPublicIP*.

   >Verify your IP address before saving the configuration. In some situations, the IP address observed by Azure portal differs from the IP address used when accessing the internet and Azure servers. Therefore, you may need to change the Start IP and End IP to make the rule function as expected. Use a search engine or other online tool to check your own IP address. For example, search for "what is my IP."

   Click **Save** on the toolbar to save this server-level firewall rule. Your final configuration should look like:

   ![Image0027](Media/image0027.png)

1. Allow access to Azure services option to Yes
    
   On your PostgreSQL server page, under **Settings** page, click **Connection security** to open the Connection security page for the Azure Database for PostgreSQL
    
   Set **Allow access to Azure services** option to **Yes** in the Azure Portal from the Connection security pane and click **Save**
    
   >This step is necessary to connect to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Server from the Azure Cloud Shell.
    
   ![](Media/image0028.png)

## Exercise 4: Get the connection information

When you create your Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Server, a default database named postgres is created. To connect to your database server, you need your full server name and admin login credentials. You can easily find the server name and login information on the server **Overview** page in the Azure Portal.

**Tasks**

1. Connect to Microsoft Azure Portal
    
   Open Microsoft Edge and navigate to the [Azure Portal](http://ms.portal.azure.com) to connect to Microsoft Azure Portal. Login with your subscriptions credential.
   
1. Go to your PostgreSQL Server

   Go to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Server in any way you prefer to look for a resource on Azure

1. Get the connection information for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Server
    
   On your PostgreSQL server page, go to the **Overview** page.
    
   Make a note of the Server name and the Server admin login name. Hover your cursor over each field, and the copy symbol appears to the right of the text. Select the copy symbol as needed to copy the values.

## Exercise 5: Connect to the PostgreSQL Database by using psql in Cloud Shell

There are several applications you can use to connect to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Server. Let's first use the psql command-line utility to illustrate how to connect to the server. You can use a web browser and Azure Cloud Shell as described here without the need to install any additional software. If you have the psql utility installed locally on your own machine, you can connect from there as well.

**Tasks**

1. Connect to Microsoft Azure Portal
    
   Open Microsoft Edge and navigate to the [Azure Portal](http://ms.portal.azure.com) to connect to Microsoft Azure Portal. Login with your subscriptions credential.

1. Open Azure Cloud Shell
    
   Select the **Cloud Shell** button on the menu in the upper-right corner of theÂ Azure Portal.
    
   ![Cloud Shell button in the Azure portal](Media/image0030.png)
    
   Select the PowerShell option for the Azure Cloud Shell
    
   ![](Media/image0031.png)
   
   When the Azure Cloud Shell is ready to use you will see a screen as the following:
    
   ![](Media/image0033.png)

1. Connect to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Server using psql tool.
    
   At the Cloud Shell prompt, connect to a database in your Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Server by typing the psql command line.
    
   To connect to an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Server with the psql utility, use the following as format:
    
   ```bash
   psql --host=<yourserver> --port=<port> --username=<server admin login> --dbname=<database name>
   ```
    
   Example

   ```bash
   psql --host=pgserverpag.postgres.database.azure.com --port=5432 --username=admpg@pgserverpag --dbname=postgres
   ```
    
   After you run the psql command with your own parameter values, you're prompted to enter the server admin password. This password is the same one that you provided when you created the server
    
   ![](Media/image0034.png)

1. Create a new database
    
   Create your own database to work with by executing:
    
   ```sql
   create database <your initials>db;
   ```
  
   ![](Media/image0035.png)
   
   List databases in the server (you will find your new database) by executing 

   ```bash
   \list 
   ```
   
   ![](Media/image0036.png)
    
   switch connections to the newly created database by executing :
    
   ```bash
   \c <your initials>db
   ```
    
   ![](Media/image0037.png)
    
   Type **\q**, and then press the **Enter** key to quit psql. You can close Cloud Shell after you're finished.
