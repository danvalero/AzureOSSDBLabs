# Azure Open Source Database PaaS Labs

This labs were created by the Azure Open Source Database Support Team for Americas

The purpose of the labs is to provide  Hands-on labs that show how the product works going one step beyond the QuickStarts and tutorials on the Azure public documentation as they cover scenarios we frequently get in support requested from our customers.

The current release covers the Single Server option for both Azure Database for MySQL and Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

- [Azure Database for MySQL Single Server](/Azure%20Database%20for%20MySQL%20Single%20Server/)
- [Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Server](/Azure%20Database%20for%20PostgreSQL%20Single%20Server/)
- [Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus)](/Azure%20Database%20for%20PostgreSQL%20-%20Hyperscale%20-%20Citus/)

In the following months, additional labs for Single Server and labs for Flexible Server will be released.
