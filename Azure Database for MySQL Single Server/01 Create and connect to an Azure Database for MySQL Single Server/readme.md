## Exercise 3: Configure a server-level firewall rule

Azure Database for MySQL creates a firewall at the server level. It prevents external applications and tools from connecting to the server and any databases on the server, unless you create a rule to open the firewall for specific IP addresses. Server-level firewall rules enable administrators to access an Azure Database for MySQL Single Server from a specified IP address or range of IP addresses.

**Tasks**

1. Connect to Microsoft Azure Portal
    
   Open Microsoft Edge and navigate to the [Azure Portal](http://ms.portal.azure.com) to connect to Microsoft Azure Portal. Login with your subscriptions credential.
    
   ![](Media/image0023.png)

1. Go to your MySQL Server

   Go to your Azure Database for MySQL Single Server in any way you prefer to look for a resource on Azure. One method is: on the Server Resources (global) bar, type the name of your server, and select it when shown

   ![](Media/image0024.png)

1. Configure firewall rule for your Azure Database for MySQL Resource

   On the MySQL server page, under **Settings** heading, click **Connection security** to open the Connection security page for the Azure Database for MySQL.

   ![](Media/image0025.png)

   Click **Add client IP** on the toolbar. This automatically creates a firewall rule with the public IP address of your computer, as perceived by the Azure system. Change the name of the rule to *Lab-VM-Public-IP*.

   ![](Media/image0026.png)

   Verify your IP address before saving the configuration. In some situations, the IP address observed by Azure portal differs from the IP address used when accessing the internet and Azure servers. Therefore, you may need to change the Start IP and End IP to make the rule function as expected. Use a search engine or other online tool to check your own IP address. For example, search for "what is my IP."

   Click **Save** on the toolbar to save this server-level firewall rule. Wait for the confirmation that the update to the firewall rules was successful

   ![](Media/image0027.png)

1. Allow access to Azure services option to YES
    
   On your MySQL server page, under **Settings** page, click **Connection security** to open the Connection security page for the Azure Database for MySQL
    
   Set **Allow access to Azure services** option to **Yes** in the portal from the Connection security pane and click **Save**
    
   >This step is necessary to connect to the Azure Database for MySQL Single Server from the Azure Cloud Shell.
    
   ![](Media/image0028.png)
    
Congratulations! You have successfully completed this exercise.

## Exercise 4: Get the connection information

When you create your Azure Database for MySQL Single Server, a default database named postgres is created. To connect to your database server, you need your full server name and admin login credentials. You can easily find the server name and login information on the server **Overview** page in the portal.

**Tasks**

1. Connect to Microsoft Azure Portal
    
   Open Microsoft Edge and navigate to the [Azure Portal](http://ms.portal.azure.com) to connect to Microsoft Azure Portal. Login with your subscriptions credential.
    
   ![](Media/image0023.png)

1. Go to your MySQL Server

   Go to your Azure Database for MySQL Single Server in any way you prefer to look for a resource on Azure

1. Get the connection information for your Azure Database for MySQL Single Server
    
   On your MySQL server page, go to the **Overview** page.
    
   Make a note of the Server name and the Server admin login name. Hover your cursor over each field, and the copy symbol appears to the right of the text. Select the copy symbol as needed to copy the values.

   ```bash
    mysql -h mysqlserverdvvr.mysql.database.azure.com -u admmysql@mysqlserverdvvr -p
   ```
    
   After you run the mysql command with your own parameter values, you're prompted to enter the server admin password. This password is the same one that you provided when you created the server
    
   ![](Media/image0050.png)

1. Create a new database
    
   Create your own database to work with by executing:
    
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE <your initials>db;
   ```
  
   ![](Media/image0035.png)
   
   List databases in the server (you will find your new database) by executing 

   ```sql
   Show Databases
   ```

   ![](Media/image0051.png)

   
   switch connections to the newly created database by executing:
    
   ```sql
   use <your initials>db;
   ```
